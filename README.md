# tic-tac-toe-game
This project is a Tic Tac Toe game I made using repl.it in 2021.

I created it for my final year project as part of a robotics course. I'm particularly proud of this project, as I encountered a lot of obstacles that I was able to overcome, thanks to God.
The game is played by selecting the desired square with the mouse. It works like any other tic tac toe game.
