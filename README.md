# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a Tic Tac Toe game I made using repl.it in 2021.

I created it for my final year project as part of a robotics course. I'm particularly proud of this project, as I encountered a lot of obstacles that I was able to overcome.

### How is it working
It works like any other tic tac toe game. Players take it in turns to select a square whose symbol ( X or O ) appears. They must complete a row, column or diagonal with their symbol to win.

## Technologies
I used:
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.9.10</li>
  <li>Turtle (module)</li>
</ul>
